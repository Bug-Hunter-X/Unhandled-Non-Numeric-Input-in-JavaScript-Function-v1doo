This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript functions: failure to handle non-numeric input. The `foo` function attempts to add two values, but it doesn't explicitly check if those values are numbers before performing the addition.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors if non-numeric values (like strings or objects) are passed as arguments. The solution demonstrates robust input validation to prevent such errors.
